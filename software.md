### Developed and maintained:

   - [dSTEM](https://github.com/zhibinghe/dSTEM) (diffential Smoothing and TEsting of Maxima/Minima): This R package provides a new generic and low-computational approach for multiple change points detection in linear models. The method is designed for the data sequence modeled as piecewise linear signal plus correlated random noise (a stationary Gaussian process). It implements the method from [Multiple Testing for Change Points Detection](https://doi.org/10.1214/20-EJS1751) and [Multiple Testing for Structural Breaks Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04368.pdf).
   
   - [phub](https://github.com/zhibinghe/Phub) (penalized hub models for network data): This R package provides the algorithms of estimations for a series of hub models, and hub set selection approach for the hub model when hub set is unknown. It implements the methods from [Network Inference Using the Hub Models and Variants](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2023.2183133).
   
   - [Extremes](https://github.com/zhibinghe/Extremes) (Extreme values distirbution in smooth Gaussian fields): This R package simulate the joint distribution of $(f,\Delta^2 f)$ conditioning on a local maximum and applications to the size of high excursion components in smooth random Gaussian Fields. The theoretical distirbutions can be found from [Peak Height Distributions of nonisotropic Gaussian random fields](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01974.pdf).
  
   - [mixme](https://github.com/zhibinghe/mixme) (Gaussian mixture models with measurement error): This R package providesthe simultaneously estimate for Gaussian mixture model combined with Measurement error and linear outcome model. The paper is available soon.

   - [jimm](https://github.com/zhibinghe/jimm) (A joint imputation framework for multiview microbiome data): A joint imputation framework for simultaneously imputing microbiome data from related biopsy locations. JIMM can determine which microbial abundances are most likely affected by non-biological factors, thus facilitating distinguishing between biological and non-biological zeros. The paper is available soon.
