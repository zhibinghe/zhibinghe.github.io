<p align="justify">
My primary research is centered around developing statistical theories and methodologies to promote statistical learning in complex data. Much of my methodology research applies to network data analysis, signal detection and epidemiologic research.</p> 




### Multiple change points detection 
<p align="justify">
The first thread of my research focuses on the extreme value distribution of Gaussian random fields with applications in change points detetcion. By kernel smoothing the piecewise linear signals, the change points (structural beaks) will be transformed to peaks (local maxima/minima). Multiple Testing is applied to identify the true change points based on the peak height distribution of smoothed Gaussian process.

### Graphical Models and Network Analysis
<p align="justify">
The second thread of my research focuses on the probability graphical models and statistical inference for network structures.

### Causal Inference
<p align="justify">
The third thread of my work focuses on the causal inference with partial interference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is a fundamental assumption in causal inference. However, this assumption is violated when units are interconnected with other units through socail or physical interactions.

### Other topics
<p align="justify">
I am also interested in a broad range of research topics, such as variable selection in highdimensional data and its applications in environmental health.
